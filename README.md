# everymac-scraper

Python script that creates a comprehensive `json` database of all items listed on everymac. Please review everymac's [Terms of Use](https://everymac.com/articles/admin/termsofuse.html). It prohibits the scraping of content. By using this software, the user takes full responsibility for their actions. Please refer to the license. This software was developed purely as a proof of concept for educational purposes regarding web security. Usage of this software should be conducted in an ethical, respectful, non-commecial and legal manner.

With that said, the US Court of Appeals denied LinkedInâ€™s request to prevent HiQ, an analytics company, from scraping its data in late 2019, effectively legalizing the scraping of content.

Use your best judgement.
