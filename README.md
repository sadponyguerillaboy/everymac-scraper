# everymac-scraper

Python script that creates a comprehensive `json` database of all items listed on everymac. Only to be used for ethical, archival, educational and non-commercial projects. Any other usage is not condoned. Everymac is already a free to use repository for the community resulting from countless hours of hard work. Be respectful.

__Requirements:__
```
bs4
pandas
requests
urllib3
```

__Usage:__
```
python scraper.py
```

__Notes:__

The only item that is not currently added to the database is the eMate 300. Its specs page is differently formated from everything else on the site and incompatible with the scrapers algorithm.
